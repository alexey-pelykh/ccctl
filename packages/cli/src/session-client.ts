/**
 * The `/api/sessions` HTTP client the `ccctl launch` / `ccctl attach` / `ccctl steer` verbs drive
 * against an ALREADY-RUNNING daemon (#38 began it, #72 completes it) — the same "act on a running
 * server" posture as the `tunnel` verb, not an in-process embed.
 *
 * Going through the daemon (rather than launching a terminal in-process) is what makes a
 * CLI-launched session land in the SAME `/api/sessions` collection the phone drives — so it
 * appears in the list "alongside phone-driven ones" AND is steerable from the CLI exactly as the
 * phone steers it (the issue's second AC). The three calls that make up the launch/attach UX:
 *
 *   - `launch` → `POST /api/sessions` (UC2): run the daemon's injected launcher and report the
 *     surface's {@link https://ccctl | TerminalAttachment} (how to attach the new terminal).
 *   - `list`   → `GET  /api/sessions` (UC1 on-ramp): enumerate the running sessions to attach to.
 *   - `steer`  → `POST /api/sessions/{id}/command` (UC1 completion): push a steer verb worker-ward
 *     on ONE addressed session, the CLI-side "take over and drive it". Resolves with the daemon's
 *     minted correlation id.
 *
 * The client asserts against the daemon's PINNED wire types ({@link LaunchAcceptedWire} /
 * {@link SessionSummaryWire}, re-exported by `@ccctl/server`), so a server wire change breaks
 * this typecheck rather than drifting silently. Modelled on the e2e harness's client helpers:
 * each round-trip is time-boxed, checks the exact success status, and fails closed with a clear
 * message — a wrong status or a shape mismatch throws, and `cli.ts` turns the rejection into a
 * non-zero exit.
