# @ccctl/e2e

End-to-end test package for [ccctl](../../README.md). The target scenario it
exercises: a **patched, headless Claude Code worker →
[`@ccctl/server`](../server) on loopback → SSE to a UI client**, asserting that
**inference still egresses to `api.anthropic.com`**. That last assertion is the
whole point: ccctl steers the control channel but must never proxy or reroute
model traffic — inference and billing stay on Anthropic under the user's own
subscription. Depends on [`@ccctl/cli`](../cli), [`@ccctl/core`](../core), and
[`@ccctl/server`](../server).

## What is wired

- **Inference-untouched guarantee (AC-5 skeleton)** — `inference-guarantee.ts`
  holds `assertInferenceUntouched`, the pure, bidirectional correctness claim
  (control traffic reaches the local server; inference reaches
  `api.anthropic.com`; a regression that redirects inference is caught).
  `traffic-harness.ts` grounds it in **real, receiver-observed connections**:
  the control leg registers with the real `@ccctl/server` (proven by its own
  session record), and the inference leg is a real outbound request carrying
  `Host: api.anthropic.com`, observed by a loopback stand-in for that host.
  `inference-guarantee.test.ts` (unit) and `inference-untouched.e2e.test.ts`
  (e2e) exercise it — hermetic, no patched worker or credentials, so it gates on
  every run.

## What is still a placeholder

- The **full happy path** — a real patched worker driven over the control
  channel with a UI SSE client, and a **real egress to `api.anthropic.com`** —
  lands in a later, credentialed wave (gated on `CCCTL_E2E` / `CCCTL_SDK_URL` /
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). `control-plane.e2e.test.ts` holds that `describe.todo`
  placeholder.

## Running

- `pnpm --filter @ccctl/e2e test` — unit specs (`src/*.test.ts`).
- `pnpm --filter @ccctl/e2e test:e2e` — end-to-end specs (`src/*.e2e.test.ts`),
  run serially. The wired skeleton is self-contained (loopback only); the
  later real specs will gate on their own env.
