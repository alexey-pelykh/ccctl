/**
 * `ISessionLauncher` — the portable port for bringing up a Claude Code session on a
 * **real, locally-attachable terminal** (#28).
 *
 * The launcher's defining contract is the SURFACE it produces: a headful terminal an
 * operator can see and sit down at on their own desk — NOT a hidden server child. A ccctl
 * session is meant to be co-driveable (steered from the browser UI *and* attachable at the
 * same terminal), so "launch" here means "open a terminal surface running the patched
 * `claude`", never "spawn a detached background process nobody can reach". That invariant
 * is the whole reason the port exists; it cannot be expressed in the type system, so every
 * backend MUST honor it.
 *
 * The port is BACKEND-AGNOSTIC — callers depend only on this interface, and the concrete
 * backend is chosen behind it. Two backends implement it:
 *
 *   - `tmux new-window` (#29) — the primary: natively attachable (`tmux attach` from a desk
 *     terminal drives the same session), so its {@link TerminalAttachment.attachable} is `true`.
 *   - an owned pty via `node-pty` (#30) — the portable fallback for environments without
 *     tmux; its attachability is DEGRADED, and that degradation is SURFACED to the operator
 *     via {@link TerminalAttachment} rather than silently hidden.
 *
 * iTerm2 stays an optional macOS-only extra, outside this set.
 *
 * Shaped after the launcher port the e2e package already uses (`PatchedWorkerLauncher` in
 * `packages/e2e/src/live-worker-oracle.ts`): an options object in, a handle with `close()`
 * out. Traces to SRV-I-001.

/**
 * What one READING of a launched surface says about it (#35) — the answer the safe-teardown rule

 * three distinct dispositions and one of them must be reachable without certainty:
 *
 *   - `alive-server-owned` — the surface is up and STILL THIS SERVER'S: nobody took it over, so
 *     tearing it down destroys nothing but what we ourselves brought up.
 *   - `taken-over` — the surface is up but the OPERATOR has it: they attached at their own desk and
 *     are driving it by hand. Killing it destroys live human work, which is the one thing teardown
 *     must never do (`SRV-B-003`).
 *   - `exited` — the surface is already gone (the worker exited, the operator closed the window).
 *     Teardown is a no-op: there is nothing left to close and nothing to be sorry about.
 *   - `unknown` — the backend could not tell. A FIRST-CLASS answer, not a failure to paper over:
 *     a probe that cannot see the surface must be able to SAY so, because the alternative is
 *     guessing, and one of the two guesses kills live work.
 *
 * **Why this is not the boolean {@link ProcessLivenessProbe} the orphan-reaper (#34) uses.** That
 * probe decides whether to retain or evict a RECORD, and a record has no stake: get it wrong and a
 * row is wrong. This reading decides whether to KILL, so "alive" is not one state but two — alive
 * and ours, alive and theirs — and the difference between them is the entire safety property. A
 * boolean cannot carry it, and `unknown` has nowhere to live in one at all.
 *
 * **`taken-over` is about SERVER OWNERSHIP, not tmux's attach state.** The word the AC uses for it
 * is "detached", meaning detached from THIS SERVER's ownership — the operator has taken the surface
 * over. It is the opposite of tmux's own "detached session" (which has no client and, for the tmux
 * backend, is precisely the still-ours case). The vocabulary here is ccctl's, deliberately, so the
 * rule reads as what it decides rather than as one backend's jargon.

 * the ingress (`ui-session-launch.ts`).
 *
 * The set partitions the failures by WHO must act:
 *
 *   - the OPERATOR's request is wrong — `invalid-cwd` (the working directory does not exist, or
 *     is not a directory), `non-prompting-mode` (a mode that could never raise the awaiting-input
 *     signal, SRV-C-003), `malformed-request` (an unparseable body);
 *   - this SERVER cannot launch at all — `launcher-absent` (no launcher was wired into it);
 *   - this SERVER will not launch RIGHT NOW — `at-capacity` (#36): every slot under the
 *     `maxSessions` cap is held by a live session, so a further launch is refused until one ends.
 *     Its own branch of the partition because it is the only failure that is neither permanent nor
 *     anybody's mistake: the request is well-formed, the host is healthy, and the same launch
 *     succeeds unchanged the moment a slot frees. That is precisely what the operator must be told
 *     — not "it broke", but "not yet";
 *   - the HOST cannot bring a surface up — `backend-unavailable` (no backend could: tmux is
 *     absent AND the owned-pty fallback could not load), `worker-not-found` (the patched
 *     `claude` binary is not executable at the path the worker argv names);
 *   - anything else — `spawn-failed`, the honest catch-all for a surface that could not be
 *     spawned for a reason the server cannot classify structurally. It is a real answer, not a
 *     dumping ground: a backend that CAN name its failure must, and only an unclassifiable one
 *     lands here.
 *
 * A BACKEND never raises `at-capacity` (nor `launcher-absent` / `malformed-request`): the cap is
 * this server's own policy, counted over state only the server holds, and it is enforced ahead of
 * the port in {@link launchSession}. A backend that has its own ceiling still reports it as
